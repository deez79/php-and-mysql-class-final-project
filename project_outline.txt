Requirements:
	1. Create a database with at least 3 tables
	2. Call to the database
	3. Use Sessions or Cookies

Idea:
	Create a database of James Bond Films, actors, directors,
	and characters	(probably not fully complete).  
	Create a user login page.
		Allow logged in users either access to additional content,
		or allow them to edit.
	Create a message board area that populates from the db.	

Source:
	Will be relying heavily on PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites,
		Fourth Edition by Larry Ullman.  Chapter 17 deals with creating
		a message board, and chapter 18 deals with logins and
		 registration.  Chapter 12 of the book deals with session and 
		 cookies, and will also be utalized.
